// What are the differences between stack and heap mem?

// Method invocations and local variable calls stored on stack (fixed size). Too many calls/items/contexts result
// in stack overflow

// Heap however grows dynamically, and is cleaned up by gc. Dynamic memory that grows and shrinks as program runs.
